<p>We need another way to fund software. All the ways we currently use are
<a href="http://dominictarr.com/post/71958587606/some-thoughts-on-the-economics-of-software-development">broken or unscalable</a>. We need a model that
Aligns the interests of the users of the software with it&#39;s creators,
while also working with the natural, copy-to-distribute, physics of data</p>
<p>So, I present feedopensource!</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Request features and <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues">post issues</a> as-per normal,
but then group (say) two weeks worth of features/bugs into an &quot;iteration&quot; which may be crowd-funded.
After each iteration, clients trial the new version, provide feedback and if they are happy with progress,
continue to fund the project.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Software only needs to be written once. Bugs need to be patched,
but a bug only needs to be patched once. Why do we pay for software so many times?</p>
<p>Either, you purchase licenses to private code (each customer paying again)
or you rent the software (&quot;As A Service&quot;), or worse of all,
you use a free service, but where your data will be mined for various purposes
(the most benign of which is advertising)</p>
<p>But, there is one business model where you actually pay for the work of creating
that software directly. You can hire a consulting company to create you bespoke software.
If you want a website or an app or anything, and do not have the desire or
the ability to create it your self, this is probably the most common way get new software!</p>
<p>See this blog post for a deeper look into
<a href="http://dominictarr.com/post/71958587606/some-thoughts-on-the-economics-of-software-development">the economics of software development</a></p>
<h2 id="the-vision">The Vision</h2>
<p>Work is funded in iterations, on a fixed time basis, a week or two at a time.
Clients and developers negioate what features they most need or are able to
build within the timeframe. Then the developers do their best to implement that,
and then the clients are able to use the results and provide feedback. Then
the next iteration is negioated. Every one is constantly in the loop. At the
same time, the clients can see the project improving, and so get a more accurate
understanding of the software development process.</p>
<p>The difference between this and typical agile consulting is that &quot;the clients&quot;
are a crowd of people. The difference between this and current crowdfunding
platforms is that Clients will have real power to influence a project,
and keep it on task.</p>
<p>Since a client does not have to commit all their money at once, the developers
must keep them satisified if are to continue to recieve funding.
For the client, most of the uncertainty about the project is removed.
They may well end up funding it even more, because they do not need to weigh up
the cost of funding against their estimations of the projects success.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-_not_-a-startup-">This is <em>not</em> a startup.</h2>
<p>This is not a platform, or Anything as a Service.
This is just on open source tool for feeding open source.
But this is also a tool for aligning a developers interests with your own.
(don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds you)</p>
<p><code>feedopensource</code> will not take any fees, have plans to signup to,
and doesn&#39;t charge anything for you to use it.
There is no terms of service that may change without notice.</p>
<p>What there is: an <a href="./LICENSE">liberal open-source license</a>, you may use <code>feedopensource</code>
to fund your own project, as <code>feedopensource</code> uses <code>feedopensource</code> to feed itself!</p>
<h2 id="the-prototype">The Prototype</h2>
<p>Here is a <em>very simple</em> prototype. On github I have a description of the goals for the
<a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues">next iteration</a>.</p>
<p>Transfer money into this bitcoin wallet <code>1PTAwipYpP63uNrcxfm5FewxRdZyar6ceu</code>
As the money in the wallet approaches the target 1.2 btc (about $1000 USD)
you&#39;ll see the progress bar fill up, and then I&#39;ll begin on the next iteration.</p>
<p><a href="bitcoin:1PTAwipYpP63uNrcxfm5FewxRdZyar6ceu"><img src="/badge/1PTAwipYpP63uNrcxfm5FewxRdZyar6ceu/1.2" alt="progress bar"></a></p>
<p>The progress bar is just a simple png that you can embed into github issues, or even an email!</p>
<p>If you would fund this if it wasn&#39;t with bitcoin please comment on
<a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/6">this issue</a></p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p><code>Clients</code> and <code>Developers</code> create <code>Tasks</code> and plan <code>Iterations</code> by posting
issues (on github or <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/7">similar</a>)</p>
<p>feedopensoure will be implemented as a bot that posts to and scrapes/api Github.
This avoids the problem of having to implement a fresh discussion platform, Notifications,
User system, etc!</p>
<p>This is gonna use bitcoin, because 1) bitcoin is open source money and 2)
bitcoin is so much easier to build services on top of than regular money.</p>
<h2 id="the-workflow">The Workflow</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>Clients</code> (users who may fund) post issues describing <code>Features</code> to be added or <code>Bugs</code> to be fixed.
(<a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/1">Tasks</a>)</li>
<li>Then, <code>Tasks</code> will be grouped into an <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/3">Iteration</a>
(an <code>Iteration</code> is just an issue that links to a set of <code>Tasks</code>, and contains a
<a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/2">progress bar</a>)
<code>Clients</code> and <code>Developers</code> can discuss that iteration, and decide to fund it or not.
Once funding is complete, the developers decide whether to accept it or not, and then work commences.</li>
<li>progress can be tracked by posting to the <code>Iteration</code> issue, or to the Task issues.
as the Tasks progress (are closed) the progress bar updates.</li>
<li>Once the Iteration is complete, the issue is closed.</li>
<li>there will be progress bar pngs representing project status and history which can easily be added into github
issues and readmes.</li>
<li>Users will have a way to associate a bitcoin wallet with a github account, to
<a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/5">claim their payment</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feed-me">Feed me</h2>
<p>Please fund the first iteration by making a payment to:
<a href="bitcoin:1PTAwipYpP63uNrcxfm5FewxRdZyar6ceu">1PTAwipYpP63uNrcxfm5FewxRdZyar6ceu</a>
and discuss here: <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/feedopensource/issues/5">Iteration 1</a></p>
